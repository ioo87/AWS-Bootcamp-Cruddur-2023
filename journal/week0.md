# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

# AWS Management Console
In the AWS console, I created an IAM user and a root user. I practiced generating and changing passwords, setting up MFA, using  access keys and assigning groups & roles. I familiarizes myself with the AWS services on the console. Other action items I completed included creating and learning about organizations and accounts.

# AWS CLI and Cloudshell
I launched Cloudshell in the Amazon console and used  aws sts get-caller-identity to check user ID, ARN (amazon resource name) and account number. I also used gitpod for CLI installation and ran environment variables for identity. Changes were published and committed to github.

# Create a budget and alarm
I logged in as an IAM user and created a My Zero Spend budget of $1.00. I also set alarms in my account.  I will like to lower the budget amount in the near future. I also set message so that I will receive notification via email when my account is approacing its limit.
